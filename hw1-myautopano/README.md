# HW1: MyAutoPano -- Phase 1

![Example showcasing how the algorithm merges the three left images into the rightmost one.](/assets/myautopano-cover.png)

The purpose of this project is to stitch two or more images in order to create one seamless panorama image.

Phase 1 of this assignment focusses on a traditional approach to the problem statement, utilizing classical techniques to detect corners and map common features between source images to splice them evenly.

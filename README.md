## How to Use This Repository

Every assignment is housed in its own folder with a report for the assigment. Follow the instructions in the README inside each folder to run the code. A general [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file contains the `venv` variables needed to run the scripts in the assignment folders.

The [repository wiki](https://github.com/neehalsharrma/RBE549-S25-S01/wiki) covers the theoretical concepts taught in the course as well as more detailed content about each assignment. The best way to view it is online on GitHub; it has also been added as a submodule for local ease of access if you wish to clone this repository -- use `git clone --recursive` so you also clone the submodule.
